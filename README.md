# Web_App
This simple web application was made by me at university class about year ago
This is how my app looked like:
"A system for processing the results of experiments at the large Hadron collider. A scientist user uploads a .csv file containing a numerical matrix of arbitrary dimension to the system. The server calculates averages and standard deviations across rows and columns, calculates the determinant of the matrix, and finds 3 other experiments with the most similar results. The client application displays statistical data in the form of graphs or charts. When the .csv file is received, the server does not immediately start calculations, but writes the received task to the queue. Only one task from the queue should be calculated at any given time".
